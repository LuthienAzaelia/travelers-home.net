Recipe for 2

I got this recipe while I was traveling through Italy.  My travel buddies and I went to a restaurant in Milan where they served this soup as an amuse bouche.  Back then I was not a fan of soups, I thought that they were just watered down food, but as it was just a small sip before the actual meal I thought I would go for it, that's when my opinion changed, with the right ingredients soups can make a very nice meal. I hope you will enjoy this recipe as much as I do.
